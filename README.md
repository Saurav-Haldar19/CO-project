CO Project group: B-46 institute -IIIT-D yr-2023: The provided code implements an assembler and simulator for a specific architecture or instruction set. It reads a code file provided from automated test cases, performs various checks on the code for syntax errors and semantic correctness, and generates the required outputs.

As per the given ISA all the instructions are implemented using functions defined at the beginning of the code code that updates all the registers, FLAGS register, variables. Then we have initialised dictionaries op(which stores the opcodes), reg(which stores the addresses of registers), regval(which stores the immediate values stored in the registers), empty dictionary var(which stores the immediate values stored in variables), mem(which stores the addresses of variables), labels(which stores the addresses of labels). We have also formed two functions for convertng binary to floating point numbers and vice-versa. Then we have read the file line by line assigned addresses to every instruction, labels and variables. We have done the required computations and after that we have updated all the register values and variable  if any happens we update the FLAGS register after each instruction.
